Sentiment Analysis with Random Forest Classifier
This project involves sentiment analysis using a Random Forest Classifier. The goal is to classify the sentiment of text reviews as positive or negative. The code includes various preprocessing steps such as removing HTML tags, URLs, punctuation, and stop words. Additionally, it applies stemming to reduce words to their root forms.

Code Overview:
1. Dependencies:
Python Libraries:
re: Regular expression library for string manipulation.
string: Provides a collection of string constants and functions.
TextBlob: A library for processing textual data, used here for sentiment analysis.
nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for various NLP tasks.
pandas: Data manipulation library.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library with tools for data preprocessing and model training.
2. Preprocessing:
Functions:
remove_html(text): Removes HTML tags from the input text.
remove_url(data): Removes URLs from the input data.
remove_punct(data): Removes punctuation from the input data.
remove_stop_words(sentence): Removes stop words from the input sentence.
stem_sentence(sentence): Applies stemming to the words in the input sentence.
preprocess(data): Applies a series of preprocessing steps to the input data.
3. Data Transformation:
The processed data is transformed into a feature matrix using the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn.
4. Model Training:
The feature matrix is split into training and testing sets.
A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the training set.
5. Evaluation:
The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the testing set.
6. Results:
The model's accuracy score is printed.
How to Run:
Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed.
Run the code in a Python environment.
Additional Notes:
The transformed data is saved as a CSV file (transformed_data.csv).
The model's accuracy score is printed to the console.
Feel free to explore and modify the code based on your needs.
